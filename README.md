# Nexus Event Tag Template

The Nexus Event tag template enables you to configure and send events to the Nexus platform, using the tracker installed with the Nexus Tracker tag.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that Google Tag Manager (GTM) and the **Nexus Tracker** tag are properly installed and configured on your website.
2. Search for the "Nexus Event" tag template in the **Community Template Gallery**.
3. Add the "Nexus Event" tag template to your GTM workspace.
4. Specify the **Event Name** (required). This is the name of the event that will be sent to Nexus.
5. Optionally, you can add **Event Properties** (key-value pairs) to further describe the event.
6. Create a trigger to assign the tag. For example, you can use a **Click - Just Links** trigger to fire the event on link clicks.
7. Publish your changes in Google Tag Manager.

Once the tag is published, events will be sent to the Nexus platform whenever the trigger conditions are met, allowing you to track specific interactions on your website.
